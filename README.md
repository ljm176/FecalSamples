# Fecal Plating Protocol

## Description
This repository contains the code for operation of the Opentrons OT2 robot to automate plating of fecal samples onto agar. Samples are reformated from 24 well racks to columns in 96 well plates and plated in a dilution series. 

Note that agar should be calibrated with the agar surface as the top of the "well".
